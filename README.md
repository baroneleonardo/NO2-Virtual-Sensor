### Abstract
Our aim is to predict NO2 concentrations, using a dataset collected from sensors.
We employ feature selection techniques to identify the most influential variables related to NO2 concentration. By reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, we aim to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of the predictive models. Subsequently, we apply three popular machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network. Through comprehensive experimentation and evaluation, we compare the performance of these machine learning models in accurately predicting NO2 concentrations.
